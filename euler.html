<p>Start thinking about how to use code to solve more logical problems. As much as web development is an expression of creativity, it's also based in problem solving (and job interviewers certainly know that) so you'll want to shake the rust off that part of your brain. Project Euler is a series of programming challenges that are best solved by using the power of computers (since many of them require you to perform simple mathematical operations on a very large scale). Some of the later problems require so much repetition and computing power that you would need to find a more elegant way of solving it than the immediately obvious "brute force" solution. We'll just do a couple of simpler ones here.</p>
<br />
<p><h3>Problem 1:</h3></p>
    <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
    <p>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>
    <p><b>Here is the code:</b></p>
    <p><pre><code>
    $(document).ready(function() {
    var sum = 0;

    for(i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
    sum = i + sum;
    $(".euler #1").text(sum);
    }
    }
    });
</code></pre></p>
<div class = "euler">
    <p>The Answer is: <span id = "1"> </span> </p>
</div>
<br />
<p><h3>Problem 2:</h3></p>
    <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p>
    <p>  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
    <p> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
    <p><b>Here is the code:</b></p>
    <p><pre><code>
        $(document).ready(function() {

        var cur = 1;
        var prev = 0;
        var total = 0;

        while(cur < 4000000) {
        if(cur % 2 === 0) {
        total += cur;
        }
        var temp = cur;
        cur += prev;
        prev = temp;
        }
        $(".euler #2").text(total);
        });
    </code></pre></p>
<div class = "euler">
    <p>The Answer is: <span id = "2"> </span></p>
</div>
<br />
<p><h3>Problem 3:</h3></p>
    <p>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.</p>
    <p>What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?</p>
    <p><b>Here is the code:</b></p>
    <p><pre><code>
    $(document).ready(function() {
    function largestPrimeFactor(n) {
    var i = 2;
    while (i <= n) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
    n /= i;
    } else {
    i++;
    }
    }
    $(".euler #3").text(i);
    }
    var num = 600851475143;
    largestPrimeFactor(num)

    });
